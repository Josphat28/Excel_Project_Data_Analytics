# Excel for Data Analytics — Student Materials & Portfolio

This repository contains the workbook materials used during the Excel for Data Analytics course together with my student work: solutions, annotated examples, and short projects that demonstrate the skills I applied while taking the course.

Purpose
- Provide a single place to browse the course files, inspect my applied work, and verify specific techniques I used to analyze and present tabular data in Excel.
- Surface the key skills I practiced and link directly to artifacts that demonstrate those skills.

Project and portfolio highlights
- 1_Salary_Dashboard.xlsx — Interactive salary dashboard that demonstrates multi-criteria aggregation, validated inputs, and visual reporting across roles and geographies.

- 0_Resources/Images/ — Screenshots and animated previews that illustrate final outputs and important implementation steps.

What I learned (skills demonstrated in this repository)
- Spreadsheet fundamentals: workbook organization, naming conventions, layout and formatting practices that improve readability and maintainability.
- Advanced formulas & functions: building conditional aggregations (e.g., MEDIAN with conditional arrays), lookup patterns (XLOOKUP / INDEX+MATCH), SUMIFS/COUNTIFS, text/date manipulations, and dynamic array usage.
- Data preparation: using Tables, structured references, missing-value handling, and conditional formatting to surface and correct issues prior to analysis.
- Visualization & communication: building and formatting charts (bar charts, map charts), sorting and labeling for clarity, and designing visuals for non-technical audiences.
- Pivot-based analysis: creating PivotTables/PivotCharts, grouping, slicers, and quick aggregation techniques for exploration.
- Decision-support tools: applying Solver, Goal Seek, Scenario Manager, and data tables for sensitivity and optimization investigations.
- Repeatable ETL: using Power Query to import, transform, and persist a reproducible series of cleaning steps.
- Data modeling & measures: constructing relationships and DAX measures in Power Pivot for complex aggregations and model-backed reporting.

Scope (chapter-by-chapter summary)
- Chapter 1 — Spreadsheets Intro: navigation, worksheets, workbook organization, and productivity shortcuts.
- Chapter 2 — Formulas & Functions: core functions, logical constructs, lookup strategies, and aggregation techniques.
- Chapter 3 — Charts: chart selection, element configuration, styles, and chart templates.
- Chapter 4 — Spreadsheets Advanced: Tables, structured references, conditional formatting, and collaboration best practices.
- Chapter 5 — Pivot Tables: building PivotTables and PivotCharts, using filters and slicers, and applying calculated fields.
- Chapter 6 — Advanced Data Analysis: Solver, Scenario Manager, Goal Seek, and data tables for what‑if and optimization tasks.
- Chapter 7 — Power Query: Query Editor, M steps, and building repeatable ETL pipelines.
- Chapter 8 — Power Pivot: data models, relationships, and DAX measures for model-driven analysis.

Where to find evidence of my work
- solutions/ or projects/ — start here for my annotated work, solution files, and short project READMEs (if present).
- 1_Salary_Dashboard.xlsx — primary project demonstrating combined skills across formulas, validation, and visualization.
- 0_Resources/Problems/ — problem workbooks used for practice; compare originals to my solutions to see applied improvements.
- 0_Resources/Images/ — visual summaries and implementation screenshots useful for quick review.

Quick verification guide (how to review an artifact)
1. Open the final workbook (for example, 1_Salary_Dashboard.xlsx) and view the Dashboard sheet to see the end result and controls.
2. Inspect raw data sheets to confirm column headers, data types, and any preprocessing or cleaning notes.
3. Open helper/calculation sheets to locate:
   - Multi-criteria aggregation formulas (e.g., MEDIAN(IF(...)) patterns).
   - FILTER / UNIQUE usage for derived lists and data validation.
4. Check chart data ranges and formatting to ensure visuals are sourced from processed calculation tables.
5. Review any README.md inside solutions/ for context: objective, key formulas/queries, assumptions, and a short conclusion explaining the insight.
